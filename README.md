# HeyCountMeIn

HeyCountMeIn is a powerful Twitter bot that helps you find accountability partners and stay motivated towards achieving your goals. By simply tagging the bot in your tweets, it will retweet your commitment and connect you with others who are interested in the same goal or activity.

## How it Works

HeyCountMeIn works as a Twitter bot that constantly monitors its mentions for new tweets. Here's how you can get started:

1. **Tag HeyCountMeIn:** Start by composing a tweet and mention [@Hey_CountMeIn](https://twitter.com/Hey_CountMeIn) in the tweet's text.
2. **State your goal:** In the same tweet, clearly state your goal or the activity you want to be accountable for. For example: "I commit to exercising for 30 minutes every day! #fitnessgoals @Hey_CountMeIn".
3. **Add relevant hashtags:** Include relevant hashtags related to your goal or activity to help others find you and connect with you. This will also help HeyCountMeIn categorize and retweet your commitment to the appropriate audience.

Once HeyCountMeIn detects your tweet, it will automatically retweet it, amplifying your commitment to its followers. Other users who are interested in the same goal or activity can then connect with you by replying to your tweet or following you directly.

## Finding Accountability Partners

HeyCountMeIn makes it easy to find accountability partners who share similar goals or activities. Here's how you can connect with others:

1. **Search for hashtags:** Browse through the tweets retweeted by HeyCountMeIn to find other users who have committed to similar goals or activities. Look for tweets that include relevant hashtags you are interested in.
2. **Reply and follow:** Engage with others by replying to their tweets and offering support or encouragement. You can also follow them to stay connected and track their progress.

Remember, the HeyCountMeIn community is built on mutual support and encouragement. Be respectful, kind, and helpful to one another as you strive to achieve your goals together.
